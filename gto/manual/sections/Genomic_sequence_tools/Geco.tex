\section{Program gto\char`_genomic\char`_compressor}
The \texttt{gto\char`_genomic\char`_compressor} is able to provide additional compression gains over several top specific tools, while as an analysis tool, it is able to determine absolute measures, namely for many distance computations, and local measures, such as the information content contained in each element, providing a way to quantify and locate specific genomic events.\\

           Default level: 5.                                           
           It defines compressibility in balance with computational     
           resources (RAM & time). Use -s for levels perception.        
                                                                        
      -tm [NB_C]:[NB_D]:[NB_I]:[NB_H]:[NB_G]/[NB_S]:[NB_E]:[NB_A]       
           Template of a target context model.                          
           Parameters:                                                  
           [NB_C]: (integer [1;20]) order size of the regular context   
                   model. Higher values use more RAM but, usually, are  
                   related to a better compression score.               
           [NB_D]: (integer [1;5000]) denominator to build alpha, which 
                   is a parameter estimator. Alpha is given by 1/[NB_D].
                   Higher values are usually used with higher [NB_C],   
                   and related to confiant bets. When [NB_D] is one,    
                   the probabilities assume a Laplacian distribution.   
           [NB_I]: (integer {0,1,2}) number to define if a sub-program  
                   which addresses the specific properties of DNA       
                   sequences (Inverted repeats) is used or not. The     
                   number 2 turns ON this sub-program without the       
                   regular context model (only inverted repeats). The   
                   number 1 turns ON the sub-program using at the same  
                   time the regular context model. The number 0 does    
                   not contemple its use (Inverted repeats OFF). The    
                   use of this sub-program increases the necessary time 
                   to compress but it does not affect the RAM.          
           [NB_H]: (integer [1;254]) size of the cache-hash for deeper  
                   context models, namely for [NB_C] > 14. When the     
                   [NB_C] <= 14 use, for example, 1 as a default. The   
                   RAM is highly dependent of this value (higher value  
                   stand for higher RAM).                               
           [NB_G]: (real [0;1)) real number to define gamma. This value 
                   represents the decayment forgetting factor of the    
                   regular context model in definition.                 
           [NB_S]: (integer [0;20]) maximum number of editions allowed  
                   to use a substitutional tolerant model with the same 
                   memory model of the regular context model with       
                   order size equal to [NB_C]. The value 0 stands for   
                   turning the tolerant context model off. When the     
                   model is on, it pauses when the number of editions   
                   is higher that [NB_C], while it is turned on when    
                   a complete match of size [NB_C] is seen again. This  
                   is probabilistic-algorithmic model very usefull to   
                   handle the high substitutional nature of genomic     
                   sequences. When [NB_S] > 0, the compressor used more 
                   processing time, but uses the same RAM and, usually, 
                   achieves a substantial higher compression ratio. The 
                   impact of this model is usually only noticed for     
                   [NB_C] >= 14.                                        
           [NB_E]: (integer [1;5000]) denominator to build alpha for    
                   substitutional tolerant context model. It is         
                   analogous to [NB_D], however to be only used in the  
                   probabilistic model for computing the statistics of  
                   the substitutional tolerant context model.           
           [NB_A]: (real [0;1)) real number to define gamma. This value 
                   represents the decayment forgetting factor of the    
                   substitutional tolerant context model in definition. 
                   Its definition and use is analogus to [NB_G].        
                                                                        
      ... (you may use several target models with custom parameters)    
                                                                        
      -rm [NB_C]:[NB_D]:[NB_I]:[NB_H]:[NB_G]/[NB_S]:[NB_E]:[NB_A]       
           Template of a reference context model.                       
           Use only when -r [FILE] is set (referential compression).    
           Parameters: the same as in -tm.                              
                                                                        
      ... (you may use several reference models with custom parameters) 
                                                                        
      -r [FILE], --reference [FILE]                                     
           Reference sequence filename ("-rm" are trainned here).     
           Example: -r file1.txt.                                       
                                                                        
      [FILE]                                                            
           Input sequence filename (to compress) -- MANDATORY.          
           File(s) to compress (last argument).                         
           For more files use splitting ":" characters.               
           Example: file1.txt:file2.txt:file3.txt.
